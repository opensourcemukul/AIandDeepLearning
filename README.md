# AIandDeepLearning
This repository contains study materials, links, codes, and tips for studying Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning (AIDL).
Here you will not find links to multiple sources to learn. Clarity is very important and thus, I have curated the best study materials so you don't have to keep searching and focus only on your learning.

How do I start learning AI and Deep Learning?

Step 1: Learn Python

    Python is the most used for AI and Deep Learning and is also the most easy to learn programming language. Even people who are not from the Computer Science background can easily learn Python and start their AIDL journey. Also, most of the online courses use Python over Jupyter Notebook as it provides an easy to use interface for programming.

Step 2: Learn Numpy
    
    Numpy is used to perform mathematical operations on the data that you have. Learning Numpy is imperative for getting into AIDL.

Step 3: Learn Pandas
    
    Pandas helps you perform operations on excel-like data. They are called dataframes in Pandas
