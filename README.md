This repository contains study materials, links, codes, and tips for studying Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning (AIDL).

How do I start learning AI and Deep Learning?

Step 1: Learn Python

    Python is the most used for AI and Deep Learning and is also the most easy to learn programming language. Even people who are not from the Computer Science background can easily learn Python and start their AIDL journey. Also, most of the online courses use Python over Jupyter Notebook as it provides an easy to use interface for programming.
